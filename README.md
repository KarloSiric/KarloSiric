# Hi there, I'm Karlo Siric 👋

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at RIT Croatia, passionate about embedded systems and low-level programming. I'm fascinated by how things work under the hood and enjoy building software from first principles.

- 🎓 Studying Computer Science at RIT Croatia
- 💻 Focused on C programming and systems development
- 🔍 Interested in operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems
- 🌱 Currently exploring the internals of Unix-like systems

## 🛠️ My C Programming Journey

I'm building a series of projects to deepen my understanding of systems programming and C:

### Current Projects:

- **Custom Shell Implementation** - Building a Unix-like shell from scratch
- **MyPrintf** - Recreating the printf function to understand formatted output
- **Wordcount** - A utility similar to Unix 'wc' command

### Upcoming Projects:

- **HTTP Server** - A basic HTTP server implemented in C
- **SQLite Clone** - A lightweight database engine
- **Unix Utilities** - Implementing core Unix commands
- **Text Editor** - A terminal-based text editor
